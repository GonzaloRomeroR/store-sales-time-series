# store-sales-time-series

In this repository we use time series to forecast store sales on data from a equadorian based grocery retailer. The goal is to build a model that accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different stores. The used dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting).
